# About me
    I'm a third year Math-CS student at UCSD, I have been taking coding courses in the past three years, I have used **phyton**, **java**, and **C++** as a coding language. 
    [You can know about my favorite coding language in this linke](Project/favoritecode.md)
## Past
    I was born in *China*, and immigrated to *United States* when I was 8, and I lived in San Francisco for most part of the time.
    > I also lived in Texas for 6 months which I did not like
## Hobby
    I play a variety of sports such as basketball and badminton, I also enjoy playing video games and reading novels.

I had a problem with committing in VScode, so I just used `git commit` to commit my work.
